Steps to solve a problem that uses Dynamic Programming logic:

1. Basic implementation:
	a. Visualize the problem on a paper on how it can be solved.
	b. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems using recursion.
	c. Formulate the base cases for recusion.
	d. Implement a bare basic solution.
	e. Identify the time and space complexity.

2. Optimization and memoization
	a. Formulate a datastructure (like a dictionary or object literal) that can hold computed values.
	b. Identify the key of the datastructure.
	c. Store the value of the recursive call with the appropriate key so that it can be re-used for both regular and base case.
